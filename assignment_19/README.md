# Assignment 19
* Create a new repository
* Write a Ruby script that uses the Rails ActiveSupport gem, installed via a Gemfile and bundler
* The script should do the following when run:


1. Show the date of the beginning of the current week
2. Show what the date will be in 30 days
3. Show what day of the week today's date will fall on next year
4. Show what day of the week the user's birthday will be on this year (don't forget to ask for it!)
5. Using the String class, pluralize a singular word the user enters and show the singular for a plural word the user enters
6. Using the String class, truncate a phrase the user enters to 20 letters
7. Using the Array class, convert an array of three words to a sentence with one command

You'll need the following Rails extensions that come with ActiveSupport:
- http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Date.html
- http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/String.html
- http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Array.html
- http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Numeric.html
