# Identify elements quiz

Answer the following questions using the code shown in this gist: https://gist.github.com/brianburridge/d6b5078f9d627a9aeddf

*Note the line numbers in the gist are referenced below.*

1. On line 1, what is being defined? A Ruby Class, named "Team"

2. What type of scope is the variable on line 2? Class variable scope. This class variable @@team_count is a counter starting at 0.

3. Explain the difference between the three attr_ methods on lines 4, 5, and 6.
  attr_accessor - creates an Instance method that can read and write the Instance variable @name (also known as an accessor method)
  attr_reader - creates a Instance method that can only read and return an Instance variable @city
  attr_writer - creates a method that can only write to an an instance variable @state

4. On line 8, what is defined? a Class method named "initialize" that sets the parameters of the object when its created

5. What is the purpose of line 9? @@team_count is a Class variable that acts as a counter that increments by 1.

6. What type of method is defined on line 12? a Class method, it keeps track of how many object instances have been created from this class. So if there were 3 objects created then Team.number_of_teams => 3

7. On line 17, could single quotes be used instead of double quotes? Why? No, because the string interpolation for #{@name} and #{self.name} would not work.

8. What is line 21 doing? This line is invoking a Private method named "set_the_city". That method is defined from line 27-line 32.

9. What is the purpose of line 25? "private" means that the method cannot be used/called by any outside object. It can only be used within the confines of whatever

10. What code can call the method defined on line 27? line 21

In the following code, how many objects are created and what are their types?

11. 2 objects

    file = File.new('content.txt')
    content = file.read


12. 1 object

    file = File.read('content.txt')


13.  1 object

    user = User.new
    user.name = 'Me'
    user.city = 'St. Petersburg'


14.In the following code, what type of variable (that is, what scope) is `count`? It is a local variable.

    def repeat
      limit = 10
      count = 0
      while count < limit
        puts count
        count += 1
      end
    end

    repeat
    puts count


15.In the code from #14, what will happen on the last line and why? An error will be thrown up because "puts count" is an invalid method because its calling on a local variable. Local variables cannot be accessed/called from outside the method or loop its included with.
